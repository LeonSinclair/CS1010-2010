Reads in 3 input files and tests if the points contained in them are on the same line. A large chunk of the comments before each function are from the lecturer as are one or two functions which have been marked as such. Contains both a simple and innefficient way of doing the calculations and then a faster way of doing them. The faster way uses insertion sort and binary search to get the results without having to brute force.

JUnit tests are also included, they also have some code from my lecturer which I have marked as such.
